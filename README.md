# Bracketify

This is a **training project** part of "Application Developper Python" OC formation. 

The software has to handle chess tournaments with swiss pairing.

## Download & Create a virtual env

For this software you will need Python 3 (made on Python 3.9.6)

Open a terminal and navigate into the folder you want Bracketify to be downloaded. 
Then run the following commands: 

* From repository download files and clone the folder.
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/AatroXissTV/Bracketify.git Bracketify
    $ cd Bracketify
    ```
* Create a Python environment named "env".
    ```
    $ python -m venv env
    ```
* Activate the environment.
    ```
    $ source/env/bin/activate #MacOS & linux
    $ source/env/Scripts/activate # Windows
    ```
* Install packages from **requirements.txt**.
    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* Once you have created the environment and the requirements.txt you can execute the script that way :
    ```
    $ python main.py
    ```
