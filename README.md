# Bracketify

This is a **training project** part of "Application Developper Python" OC formation. 

The software has to handle chess tournaments with swiss pairing.

## Download & Create a virtual env

For this software you will need Python 3 (made on Python 3.9.6)

Open a terminal and navigate into the folder you want Bracketify to be downloaded. 
Then run the following commands: 

* From repository download files and clone the folder.
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/AatroXissTV/Bracketify.git Bracketify
    $ cd Bracketify
    ```
* Create a Python environment named "env".
    ```
    $ python -m venv env
    ```
* Activate the environment.
    ```
    $ source/env/bin/activate #MacOS & linux
    $ source/env/Scripts/activate # Windows
    ```
* Install packages from **requirements.txt**.
    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* Once you have created the environment and the requirements.txt you can execute the script that way :
    ```
    $ python main.py
    ```

## Future Updates

This is the first version of Bracketify. The files are not structured with MVC yet. 
I'm only trying to have player management done first.

I'm using the CRUD method (Create, read, update, delete) for the player management system

You can consult the project management board if you want accurate tracking of progress made. 

### To Do list
- [ ] CRUD files converted into MVC CRUD Files for the player management system.
